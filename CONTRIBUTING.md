# Contributing

## Can I contribute?

Absolutely! Please remember that we have a product roadmap in mind so [open an issue](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/issues) about the feature you'd like to contribute before putting the time in to code it up. We'd hate for you to waste _any_ of your time building something that may ultimately fall on the cutting room floor.

## How do I run the code?

Assuming you're on macOS:

  1. `./script/setup`
  2. `mix ecto.setup`
  3. `mix phoenix.server`

Now visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.
The database contains some seed data you can start with.

## Adding yourself to the [contributors table](https://github.com/thechangelog/changelog.com/blob/master/README.md#contributors)

As part of your pull request, please also feel free to add yourself to the contributors table.

Simply run `yarn run add` and follow the prompt. This will update the `.all-contributorsrc` file
with your information. If you need to make changes, you can run `yarn run add` again, or manually
change the `.all-contributorsrc` file and run `yarn run generate`.
